			<h1>Mumbai safety</h1>
			<p>Mumbai is also widely known as Bombay, with more than 21 million inhabitants.
It is considered to be the biggest city in terms of population in the whole world.
Mumbai is popular with tourists due to its numerous temples, bazaars, museums.</p>
             <h1>Warnings & Dangers in Mumbai</h1>
             <img src="img/risk.jpg" alt="Computer Man" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br>
             <h1>OVERALL RISK: HIGH</h1>
             <p>Because Mumbai is a huge and populous city, the level of crime is high. Travelers can easily become victims so they need to avoid traveling alone on public transport or in taxis, especially at night. There have been reports of British tourists becoming the victims of a scam by taxi drivers.</p>
             <img src="img/taxi.jpg" alt="Computer Man" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br>
             <h1>TRANSPORT & TAXIS RISK : MEDIUM</h1>
             <p>The taxi meters scams are frequent occurrences in Mumbai and the taxi drivers may change the price for their service during the ride. The public transport is dangerous due to the pickpockets, so be careful on the overnight trains and buses. Do not hail taxis on the street. In case you want to drive a car or ride a motorbike, be aware that road accidents are the main cause of death in India, so make sure to wear a helmet when on motorbike.</p>

             <h1>PICKPOCKETS RISK : HIGH</h1>
             <p>Wherever there are a lot of tourists, pickpockets are operating. So, the commercial capital city of India is not an exception and has a serious problem. It is always advisable to keep an eye on your belongings whenever you are in busy and crowded areas of the city.</p>
             <img src="img/mug.jpg" alt="Computer Man" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br>
             <h1>MUGGING RISK : LOW</h1>
             <p>When it comes to kidnapping and mugging, it is not common and the risk of being seriously assaulted does not exist. You can feel free when these kinds of crimes are in question.</p>
             <img src="img/ter.jpg" alt="Computer Man" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br>
             <h1>TERRORISM RISK : HIGH</h1>
             <p>India is very exposed to terrorism and the risk is high. Terrorist groups include Lashkar-e Tayyiba, Jaish-e Mohammed and the Indian Mujahideen. The places visited by British nationals, such as religious sites, markets, and beaches, are the main targets. What you, as a traveler, should do is to check the local media before planning your travel.</p>
             <img src="img/scam.png" alt="Computer Man" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br>
             <h1>SCAMS RISK : HIGH</h1>
             <p>Mumbai is the city where the unfair individuals might try to fool you to obtain the money from you, particularly if you are a distracted tourist. Some of the frequent scams are importing gemstones scam, fast meter scam in a taxi and beg for milk or pen which are very well known throughout whole India.</p>
             <img src="img/women.jpg" alt="Computer Man" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br>
             <h1>WOMEN TRAVELERS RISK : HIGH</h1>
             <p>When the safety of a sole woman in India is in question, the risk of being sexually assaulted is at a very high level. Women travelers often receive both verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks are constantly happening, so women travelers should exercise caution when traveling in India even if traveling in a group.</p>
             <h1>So... How Safe Is Mumbai Really?</h1>
             <p>Like most parts of India,  some of the most common crimes in Mumbai are purse-snatching, which can sometimes be done from a motorcycle, so it is advisable not to have your valuable things and money with you in your purse.

Only tourists who are vigilant and smart should travel to Mumbai and it is never a good idea to travel there alone.
Though it is not very common for tourists to be victims of any sort of violent crime, it happens sometimes.

Make sure not to speak too much about yourself to unknown people and do not accept any drinks.

Women should bear in mind that there have been recent cases of sexual assaults reported from all over the country.</p>
