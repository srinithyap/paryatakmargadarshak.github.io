		<h1>safety</h1>
				<p>If we take into account the safety index of the city, which is just 45, it can be said that Delhi is a very dangerous city in terms of criminal acts. People who visit Delhi for the first time might become easy prey for experienced thieves and this usually affects their overall image of India.<br>
			1.TRANSPORT & TAXIS RISK : MEDIUM
You need to be very careful if you decide to drive in Delhi since driving is very frantic and dangerous. In case you rent a motorcycle, never forget to use a helmet. Getting around Delhi can be difficult even for the experienced tourist. The best way to travel around the city is by using the metro, with a special compartment for women. It is prohibited to carry alcohol in Delhi metro and after a security check all lighters, matches, and alcohol are confiscated.<br>
2.PICKPOCKETS RISK : HIGH
Pickpockets usually operate in Delhi, and that is a real problem that authorities are trying to fight against. To feel safe in Delhi, be careful when in public transport and around the sights, which are the main hubs of bag snatchers and thieves.<br>
3.NATURAL DISASTERS RISK : HIGH
Natural disasters are very frequent in India and earthquakes and flooding often occur. Delhi is also prone to fires and wind storms.<br>
4.MUGGING RISK : LOW
The best thing about Delhi is that the risk of being kidnapped is at the lowest level and it can be said that there is no possibility that this kind of criminal activity happens to tourists. Mugging is not frequent but can occur sometimes.<br>
5.TERRORISM RISK : HIGH
The level of terrorist risk in India is at a very high level as some numerous individuals and groups are against Western activities. Tourists can be affected if happen to be at the place where the attack occurs.<br>
6.SCAMS RISK : HIGH
Taxi drivers are usually very fond of taking advantage of tourists that do not know the city so they turn on a fast taxi meter or tour them around the city. To avoid that, take only official taxis. There have been some reports that unlicensed taxis took people to the wrong hotel. Unfortunately, Delhi has a lot of beggars and so tourists should remain watchful of those people trying to help them.<br>
7.WOMEN TRAVELERS RISK : HIGH
This is the city where female travelers are not advised to come alone since sexual assaults might happen. The first car in trains is designed for women, so it is safe to travel via metro. In order not to attract unwanted individuals, women should dress conservatively.<br></p>
